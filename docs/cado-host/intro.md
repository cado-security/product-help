# Cado Host
Cado Host is a solution to acquire forensic artefacts from systems and place them into cloud storage, enabling you to perform a quick triage investigation of a target system.
Data is collected and stored in a zip file that can be automatically uploaded to Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Storage. It also supports storing captured files locally.
Once collected, these artefacts can be imported, processed and analysed in the Cado Response platform.

Cado Host binaries are available for:
- Microsoft Windows: 7, 8.1, 10 (1607+) and Microsoft Windows Server Server 2012 R2+
- Linux: Debian: 9+, Ubuntu: 16.04+, Fedora: 29+, CentOS: 7+, RHEL: 6+, openSUSE: 15+, SUSE Enterprise (SLES): 12 SP2+, Alpine: 3.10+
- MacOS (Intel based only): 10.13+
