# How does high availability work in Cado?

The Cado platform can be deployed in a High Availability (HA) configuration allowing a multi-AZ deployment using managed services and an auto-scaling group with a load balancer. This deployment adds complexity, but may be required in some environments that require high availability due to regulatory or operational requirements. To deploy with HA, please contact the Cado Sales team at sales@cadosecurity.com.
