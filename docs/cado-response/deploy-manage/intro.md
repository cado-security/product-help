# Cado Response Deployment Options

Cado Response can be deployed in either AWS or Azure.

**[Learn how in AWS >](aws/overview.md)**

**[Learn how in Azure >](azure/azure-deploy.md)**

When you deploy Cado in AWS you can import data "cross-cloud" from Azure or GCP. **Cross cloud** means that Cado Response is deployed in one cloud environment, but importa data from another.
