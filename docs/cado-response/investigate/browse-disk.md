# Browse Disk

When you select a piece of disk evidence in the Project Overview tab, a Browse Disk Tab will appear.

Browse Disk shows a hierarchical view of the file system. Cado Response marks directory structures where Cado has found Alarms or Suspicions with red or yellow dots respectively. Clicking on a folder allows you to drill down into that structure.

Clicking on a file takes you to the details for that file, inlcuding links to search Open Threat Exchange (OTX) and VirusTotal if you have those [set up](../settings-reference/general-settings.md#detections).

This tab also shows any key events (alarms, suspicions) associated with this file.
