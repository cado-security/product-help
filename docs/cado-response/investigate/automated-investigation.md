# What is the Automated Investigation tab?

The Automated Investigation tab provides a summary of what Cado has determined during its investigation.

The Automated Investigation includes:
* A description of how the investigation was triggered
* The verdict - a one line description of what Cado determined has happened
* A set of suspected compromised assets

The timeline displays up to 50 events. Events are more likely to be included if they are malicious, tagged by a user, happened in rapid succession, etc.
