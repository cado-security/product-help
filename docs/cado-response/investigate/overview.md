# Project Overview
The Project Overview lets you understand:
* what data has been processed within Cado Response
* what are the high level results of the analysis within Cado Response

## Project Visualization
The Project Visualization depicts - in a graph format - an overview of the most critical alarms and suspicions, the files and users associated with them, and the links between them. This allows an investigator to quickly hone in on the likely root cause of the issue.

The controls on the graph allow you to zoom in, zoom out and pan across the graph. The control in the bottom left hand corner of the digaram shows where you are in the graph relative to its entirety.

## Evidence List
The Evidence List shows which data has been collected as part of this project, and the current processing status of that data. Clicking on the menu icon to the right of a piece of evidence allows you to delete that piece of evidence.

Expanding a piece of evidence provides a detailed processing history for that piece of evidence.
