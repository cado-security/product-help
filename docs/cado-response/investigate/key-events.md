# Key Events
Cado parses events from evidence items. These events may have times associated with them. They may also be tagged as `Alarm`, which indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity, or `Suspicious`, which indicates a lower likelihood of malicious activity.

The **Key Events** tab contains all timeline events tagged as `Alarm` or `Suspicious`, whereas the **Alarms** and **Suspicious** tabs contains only events tagged as `Alarm` and `Suspicious` respectively

Each key timeline event shows why Cado Response has tagged that event as an `Alarm` or `Suspicious`
