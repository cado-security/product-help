# AWS S3 Support

Cado Response supports acquistion of data from AWS S3 buckets. The two main use cases for this are:

* Analyzing disk images or zip files that have been uploaded to an S3 bucket as part of an investigation (e.g. as part of using Cado Response Community Edition)
* Analyzing the contents of an S3 bucket for any uploaded content that could be part of an incident

While the project is open, select *Import - Artifacts from S3*. Select or search for the bucket you require. Navigate and select the objects you need, or hit "Import Entire Bucket".
