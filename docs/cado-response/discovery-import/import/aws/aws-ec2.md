# AWS EC2 and EBS Support

Cado Response supports acquisition of EC2 instances. While the project is open, select *Import - AWS EC2 Instance*. Select the region from which you want to acquire an instance and select the appropriate role. This will populate a list of available instances.

You can filter the list of instances and buckets by instance ID, name, state or public IP address.

Click on "Acquire Volume" or "Acquire Memory" 

For volume capture, set the options for what data you want to capture, plus any optional labels for chain of custody and hit "Acquire Instance"
