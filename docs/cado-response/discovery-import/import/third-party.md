# Importing from Third Party Tools

### Full Disk Collections using FTK Imager
Triage collections are reccomended instead of full disk images, as they are smaller and faster to process.

However, a number of tools can be used to create full disk images of a system, which can then be uploaded to cloud storage for import into Cado. One of the most popular tools is FTK Imager.

FTK Imager is a free tool that can be used to create disk images of a system. The tool can be downloaded from the [Exterro website](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-product-downloads/ftk-imager-version-4-7-1).

A [tutorial](https://cloudnine.com/ediscoverydaily/electronic-discovery/how-to-create-an-image-using-ftk-imager-ediscovery-best-practices/) is available on the CloudNine website that explains how to create a disk image using FTK Imager.

Cado can import full disk images in a number of formats, includign .dd and .e01.


### KAPE and Velociraptor
Cado can process forensic collections in ZIP format from open source forensics tools like [KAPE](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape) and [Velociraptor](https://www.rapid7.com/products/velociraptor/).
