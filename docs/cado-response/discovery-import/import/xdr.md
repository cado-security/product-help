## Deployment from XDR Integrations
You can quickly deploy Cado Host to Windows and Linux machines that may be compromised through XDR vendors such as Crowdstrike, SentinelOne and Microsoft Defender (Defender is in beta). Please note that macOS is not currently supported currently for the mentioned XDR vendors. 
For more information, see [Crowdstrike](/cado-response/manage/integrations/xdr/crowdstrike) and [SentinelOne](/cado-response/manage/integrations/xdr/sentinelone).
