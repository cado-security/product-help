## Deployment from XDR Integrations
You can quickly deploy Cado Host to Windows and Linux machines that may be compromised through XDR vendors such as Crowdstrike and SentinelOne. Please note that macOS isn't currently supported. 
For more information, see [Crowdstrike](/cado-response/manage/integrations/xdr/crowdstrike) and [SentinelOne](/cado-response/manage/integrations/xdr/sentinelone).
