# Azure Storage Support

Cado Response supports acquistion of data from Azure Blob Storage. The two main use cases for this are:

* Analyzing disk images or zip files that have been uploaded to an Azure Blob Storage continer as part of an investigation
* Analyzing the contents of an Azure Blob Storage container for any uploaded content that could be part of an incident

While the project is open, select *Azure Storage*. Select or search the account you require, select the container and the click the download icon for the appropriate blob.
