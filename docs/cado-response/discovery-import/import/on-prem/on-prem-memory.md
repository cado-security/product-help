# Memory from On-Premises Systems
The Cado platform uses [Cado Host](/cado-host/intro) to acquire memory from on-premises systems.

You can perform a memory acquisition of a Windows or Linux system using Cado Host by clicking `Import > Forensic Artifcats` and running the pre-generated script on the host device.
