# Importing from XDR

You can import data into the Cado platform via an eXtended Detection and Response (XDR) system. Currently Cado supports importing from SentinelOne. For more infomation about setting up this integration see the [SentinelOne Integration Setup page](../../../manage/integrations/xdr/sentinelone.md)

Once the integration is set up, from within a project click **Import - XDR Endpoints**
