# Google Cloud Storage Support

Cado Response supports acquistion of data from GCP Storage Buckets. The two main use cases for this are:

* Analyzing disk images or zip files that have been uploaded to an Azure Blob Storage continer as part of an investigation
* Analyzing the contents of a GCP Storage Bucket for any uploaded content that could be part of an incident

While the project is open, select *GCP Storage*. Select the project you require, select the bucket and then select the objects to import.
