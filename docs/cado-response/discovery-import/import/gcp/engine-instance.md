# Google Cloud Engine Support
Cado Response supports acquisition of GCP Compute instances. While the project is open, select *Import - GCP Engine Instance*. Select the appropriate project, and this will populate a list of GCP buckets where you can upload the image prior to importing it into the Cado Response Platform.

You can search for and select the GCP Compute Instance you need. Click on the "Acquire Instance" button next to the instance to import.
