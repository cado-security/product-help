# How to integrate Wiz with Cado Response

The Cado Platform automates the processing and analysis of AWS EC2 EBS volumes acquired using the Wiz Platform. Using Wiz and Cado Platform together you can automate the collection, processing, and analysis of AWS EC2 virtual machines without explicitly having to grant Cado access to the environment where the EC2 resides.
