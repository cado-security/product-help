# Overview

The Cado Response APIs enable third party tools and automation scripts to integrate with the Cado Response platform. This section provides a quick onboarding flow that is required for every integration with our APIs.

You can use the API and the pre-made out-of-the-box integrations to trigger operations in the platform (e.g. acquire instances from your cloud environments, retrieve data that our system captured like suspicious events, manage and control investigation projects, and more).


### Generate API Secret
To access the different resources of the API, requests must include a valid API Key generated by the Cado Response platform.

To generate an API Key, log into your Cado Response instance, go to the “Settings” page, then choose the “API” tab and click the “Create New Key” button. You will see a popup with a secret and public key.  The secret key is the API Key that must be included in each request, and the public key is the identifier that can be used to revoke the key at a later time, if needed.

:::tip
The API secret key will only be shown once, so it is recommended to save it to in a secure place, like a password manager.

### Platform Base URL
When referncing the API guides, the term "Platform Base Url" is often referenced.  This refers to the IP/Domain of where the platform has been deployed, for example:
```
https://ec2example.compute.amazonaws.com
```
