# Overview

Cado API enables 3rd party tools and automations scripts to integrate with the Cado Response platform. This section provides a quick onboarding flow that is required for every integration followed in this section.

You can use the API and the pre-made out-of-the-box integrations to trigger operations in the platform (e.g. acquire instances from your cloud environments), retrieve data that our system captured (e.g. suspicious events), manage and control investigation projects, and more.


### Generate API Secret
Before diving into any of the integrations we have with the Response Platform  - we firstly need to understand what is the correct way we should access it.

To be able to access the different resources of the API, any request must be provided with a valid API Key generated by our authentication server.
To generate that key, go to the “Settings” page (bottom left), then choose the “API” tab and click on the “Create New Key” button. You should see a popup with a secret and public key*.
The secret key is the API Key that we need to provide with each request, and the public key is the identifier that we can use for revoking the key later on if needed.

:::tip
The API secret key will only be shown once, so it is recommended to save it to a secured place, like password manager.

### Platform Base URL
Often you'll see in the following tutorials that we are referring to "Platform Base Url" - which is the IP/Domain of where the platform was deployed, for example:
```
https://ec2example.compute.amazonaws.com
```

5. Configure Access Control
	- Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and select the **Properties** blade and make sure **User assignment required?** is set to `Yes`. This means only assigned users will be allowed to log into Cado Response

	- Navigate to **Users and Groups**
	- Click **Add User/Group** and add any users you want to give access to the app. If you created an admin role, you can assign the new users the admin role to give them admin access within Cado Response.
6. Create a secret to allow authentication with Cado Response
	- From the home page, open **Azure Active Directory** and select the **App Registrations** blade
	- Select your application (you may need to switch to the **All Applications** tab if you are not an owner)
	- Select the **Clients & Secrets** blade and click **New Client Secret**
	- Make a note of the **Value**, you will need this in Cado Response.
7. Collect other required information
	- Select the **Overview** blade and make a note of the following values:
		- `Application Client ID`
		- `Directory (Tenant) ID`
		- `Client Secret` (which you should already have from previous step)
8. Whitelist the redirect URL
	- Select the **Authentication** blade
	![Azure Authentication](/img/azure-authentication.png)
	- Click **Add a Platform**
	- Select **Web** and input your redirect url. This should be the url you use to access Cado Response in the web browser, including the `/login` path. Example: `https://my.cado.instance/login`
9. Configure SSO in Cado Response
	- Open your Cado Response instance and log in as an admin user
	- Go to **Settings > OAuth**
	- Enter the Microsoft OAuth details you noted earlier and click **Update**
