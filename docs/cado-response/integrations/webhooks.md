# Webhook Integration
A webhook integration allows you to automatically send information from Cado Response to another application using a unique URL.

## Before You Begin
To add the webhook integration from Cado Response, you will need to generate a webhook URL from your desired application. Most applications that can receive a post request can be supported.

To view and manage your webhooks settings navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Webhooks**.

## Add or Modify a Webhook
To add a new webhook click the **New webhook** button at the bottom of the settings page.

You can modify an existing webhook by simply clicking the **Edit** button. Any new events will be sent to the updated URL or modified payload.

You will then see a form where you must enter all the following:
- **Name**: The name of the webhook to describe what it is.
- **URL**: The webhook URL generated by the application you wish to integrate with.
- **Events to send**: Tick the events you wish to send from Cado Response to your webhook URL. Only high severity alarms are supported currently.
- **Payload**: This is a JSON object that refers to how the webhook URL will receive the data. A webhook must be in the correct format, more information can be found **[here](#custom-payloads)**.

## Delete an Existing Webhook
Delete an existing webhook by clicking the associated **Delete** button. Any new webhooks will not be sent to the entered URL.

## Custom Payloads
When entering a webhook you must specify a payload. This is how the webhook URL receives the data from Cado Response. The payload must be a valid JSON object and have both **\$Title** and **\$Event** as values somewhere in the JSON object. These values tell Cado Response where to enter the data about the event.

:::note
When entering the payload refer to the documentation of the application you wish to integration to understand the format the payload must be in. If the payload is not in the correct format for the destination application the event may not be received.

An example of a valid payload:
```json
{
    "title": "$Title",
    "message": "$Event"
}
```
