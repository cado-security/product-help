# SIEM Integration

SIEM integration with Cado Response is finally here! SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a tool that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware - an essential capability for SecOps teams to cross events and logs from different systems and manage risks more wisely. The integration with the Cado Response platform leverages the power of SIEM systems with Cadoâ€™s forensics unique value in the cloud.

The processed timeline from Cado Response will be converted to a standard format (CEF) so it can be universally read by SIEM systems. The CEF file will then be uploaded to your AWS S3 bucket and folder of choice. You can configure your SIEM system to automatically check for new files in the S3 bucket and to add them to your SIEM system automatically.

## Getting Started

Before you can export the timeline you need to enable SIEM integration found under **Settings -> Integrations -> SIEM**. After it is enabled you can set the S3 bucket and S3 folder you wish for the timeline to be exported to. When enabled whenever you import an evidence item, the timeline will be automatically converted and uploaded to S3.

# Cado Response CEF Standard

This is a sample CEF log that can be generated by Cado Response:

**CEF:0|CadoSecurity|CadoResponse|1.0.2|0|Content Modification Time|10|alarm=True evidence_id=2 evidence_name=aws_compromise.zip macb=M... source=FILE eventTime=1595194940 filePath=/tmp/file.txt eventId=Q5FBqHwBX9dvp1T5IsHT msg=Malicious File Detected: cryptomining_malware_wannamine**

The log follows the below standard:

**CEF:0|CadoSecurity|CadoResponse|Version|Signature ID|Name|Severity|Extension**

The extension part of the message is a placeholder for additional fields that are represented by key-value pairs. The keys are part of a predefined set and are outlined below.
