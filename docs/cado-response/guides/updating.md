# Updating Your Cado Response Instance

You can view version information and trigger updates by clicking **Updates** from the **Settings** menu.

The default update mechanism requires the ability to have an outgoing connection to our secure update server hosted on bitbucket.org. For air-gapped networks, we also support either updating from a direct URL or copying files to the server over SFTP for a local import.
