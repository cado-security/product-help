# Updating Your Cado Response Instance

You can view version information and trigger updates by clicking **Updates** from the **Settings** menu.

The default update mechanism requires the ability to have an outgoing connection to our secure update server hosted on bitbucket.org. Alternatively, for AWS, you can specify an AMI ID within the same region the Cado Response platform is deployed, and update via that custom AMI.
