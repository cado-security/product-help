# Licensing
By default, Cado Response ships with a **Community License** which includes a subset of capabilities, compared to a **Full License**.  If you have received a license file from your Sales representative, continue to **[Applying a License](licenses#applying-a-license)**

If you wish to upgrade to a **Full License**, please contact support@cadosecurity.com

### Applying a License
Once you receive your license file, you can upload it by:
- Logging into your Cado Response instance
- Navigate to **Settings**
- Click the **License** tab
- Click **Select file**, choose the new license file 
- Click **Upload**
