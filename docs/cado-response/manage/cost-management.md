# Estimating the costs for running the Cado platform in AWS
You can view the AWS Cost Calculator for a typical Cado installation on our [AWS Marketplace Listing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-2ol4yojhc5vpa).

Typical assumptions include:
- A central platform server running permanently with 500 GB of space for hot data access
- 36.5 hours (5% of the time) worker usage to process data
- 500 GB of permanent S3 Storage used for forensic images
- 50 GB of Elastic File System Storage used for file transfer downloads
