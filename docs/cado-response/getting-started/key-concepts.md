# Key Concepts
Below are the key concepts within Cado Response.

### Evidence
An evidence item is a source of data. It may be a single file, or a folder or archive containing many files.

### Projects
A project is a grouping of different evidence items, and also holds information such as notes users have made.

### Events
Cado Response parses events from evidence items. These events may have times associated with them. They may also be tagged as `Malicious`, which indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity, or `Suspicious`, which indicates a lower likelihood of suspicious activity.
