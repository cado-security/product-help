# How is Chain of Custody Maintained in Cado?

Cado maintains the chain of custody by tracking details of imported evidence. You can view this information by navigating to **Import > Evidence**, where you will find metadata related to the imported evidence.

Information about which user imported the evidence and when it was imported is available under **Help > Audit Logs**.
