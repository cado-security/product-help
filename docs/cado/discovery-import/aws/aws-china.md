# How to Import from AWS China

The / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation platform does not currently support direct deployment into AWS China regions. The following guidance should be considered in accordance with your organizationâ€™s policies and local regulations regarding cross-border data transfers.

### Collecting Data Using / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host

You can use **/ Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host** to collect data from any system in AWS China, as long as it has an outgoing internet connection. This data can then be transferred to your primary / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation instance in a supported global AWS region.

### Manually Acquiring Data from AWS China

To manually transfer data from AWS China regions, you can use the AWS CLI to copy the data to a / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation supported region. For assistance with transferring data between AWS partitions, contact AWS Support.

### Syncing Data Using External Tools

Several AWS and third-party tools can help sync data between regions. However, these tools are not officially supported or endorsed by / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation. Examples include:
- [s3sync on GitHub](https://github.com/issacg/s3sync)
- [AWS Guide on AMI Store and Restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-store-restore.html)
