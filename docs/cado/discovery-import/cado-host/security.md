# Security Considerations for / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host

- **Static Analysis**: / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host releases undergo the same static analysis as the primary platform in our release pipeline, ensuring thorough security checks.
- **Code Signing**: / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host Windows binaries are signed with an Azure Trusted Signing code signing certificate, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
- **Custom Storage Options**: Customers can configure their own storage bucket or web server to host the / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host binary. This allows for scanning the binary with their own security tools, though it requires maintaining the latest version.
- **Temporary Write-Only Credentials**: Cado Host uses limited-time, write-only credentials generated by the platform for accessing cloud storage, minimizing security risks.
- **Encrypted Communication**: All communication between / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host and cloud storage is encrypted using TLS, ensuring data security during transfer.

### Privilege Requirements

/ Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host requires **elevated privileges** to access raw disk and memory for full forensic collection. Running without elevated privileges will limit its ability to access these resources, preventing a complete forensic investigation.
