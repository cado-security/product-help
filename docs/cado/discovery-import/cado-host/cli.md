# Cado Host CLI Documentation

## Usage
```bash
cado-host [-h] [--verbose] [--version] {capture,upload,clean} ...
```

### Options
- `-h, --help`  
  Show the help message and exits.
- `--verbose`  
  Enable verbose output.
- `--version`
  Returns the current version of Cado Host.

## Commands

### `capture`
Capture and triage files based on chosen configuration.

#### Options
- `-c {default,light,max}, --collection_mode {default,light,max}`  
  Selects the collection mode which changes how Cado Host will search for files:  
  - `default`  
    Searches and collects the default set files of files as outlined [here](/cado/discovery-import/cado-host/artifacts). This is the default option.
  - `light`  
    Searches and collects files smaller than 10MB.  
  - `max`  
    Searches and collects a larger set of files regardless of size. This will slow capture down significantly.

- `-a [FILE ...], --additional_files [FILE ...]`  
  List multiple files or folders to collect, separated by spaces.

  :::tip
  **Note:** Folders should NOT have trailing slashes. File and folder paths must be separated by spaces and enclosed in double quotes. For example:
  ```console
  cado-host.exe capture --additional_files "C:\tools\secretfile.txt" "C:\SuperSecretFolder"
  ```
  :::

- `-ap PATH, --additional_files_path PATH`  
  Path to a local file containing a list of files or folders to collect, one per line.

- `--only_additional_files`  
  Only collect files and folders specified in `--additional_files`.

- `--groups [GROUP ...]`  
  Collect a specific group of files. Use `--list_groups` to see available groups. If no groups are specified, all groups will be collected.

- `--list_groups`  
  List all available groups of files that can be collected.

- `-o PATH, --output_path PATH`  
  Path where Cado Host will save the collection.

- `--skip_scan`
  Skip scanning for extra files against known signatures.

- `--root_path PATH`  
  The path where Cado Host will start its file search from.

#### Kubernetes Specific Options

- `--target_container TARGET_CONTAINER`  
  Selects a target container in a Kubernetes cluster.

- `--skip_root_check`  
  Skips the root permissions check when collecting a Kubernetes container.

  :::warning
  **Note:** This should only be used when you are sure that the `sysadmin` profile is available. See the [Kubernetes docs](/cado/discovery-import/kubernetes#root-access) for more information.
  :::

#### Windows Specific Options

- `--include_memory`  
  Acquires process memory, this can be slow on Windows systems as it will acquire process memory regardless of size.

#### Linux Specific Options

- `--skip_memory`  
  Skips memory collection for a faster capture.

- `--include_large_memory`  
  Includes open files and memory even if it exceeds 1MB in size. This will slow capture down significantly.

### `upload`
Upload an existing Cado Host capture file, or other files. **This will clean up the uploaded resource locally by default.**

:::tip
When using `cado-host upload` to upload single files to the platform, please use `--no_cleanup` to ensure Cado Host doesn't delete the file after upload.
:::

#### Arguments
- `PATH`  
  Path of the file to upload and import into the Platform.

#### Options
- `--presigned_data DATA`  
  Encoded upload credentials generated by the platform.

- `--no_cleanup`  
  Disable self-cleanup after triage upload.
  
- `--skip_ssl_verify`  
  Explicitly allow Cado Host to skip SSL verification when uploading to cloud storage. **This is insecure.**

  :::warning
  **Note:** This should only be used as a last resort, useful when proxies in enterprise deployments require the use of a custom self-signed certificate.
  :::

### `clean`
Cleans up previous runs and logs to free up disk space. Searches temporary folders and the current folder.
