## Creating a Bucket
- Open the Storage Browser.
- Click Create Bucket.
- Create the bucket using your desired settings.

## Creating Credentials
- Go to Storage Settings.
- Select your project, then select Interoperability.
- Click Create a Key for a service Account.
- Click Create a New Account.
- Type the name of the account, then grant the Storage Object Creator permission.
- This grants permission to write objects to a storage bucket, but not list or download objects.
- Click through to create the account, and copy the Secret Key and Access Key.

In the end, you are ready to go when you have:
1. The Access Key
2. The Secret Key
3. The Bucket Name
