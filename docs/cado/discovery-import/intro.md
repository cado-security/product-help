## Import Options

### Importing from Cloud Services

You can import evidence from cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. Ensure that the correct credentials are added to the system and that your role is granted access to use these credentials.

For a step-by-step guide, visit our [Cloud Import Documentation](import-from-cloud.md).

### Importing from / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host

The / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation platform can use **/ Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host** to acquire forensic artifacts from on-premises systems and analyze them in the cloud. Additionally, Cado Host can upload evidence, like previously collected disk images.

To learn more about using / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation Host, see the [Cado Host Documentation](/cado/discovery-import/cado-host/intro).

### Importing from a URL

If youâ€™ve stored forensic artifacts at a URL, you can import them directly into the platform. Ensure that the file types are supported by checking the list of compatible [file types](data-types/filetypes.md).
