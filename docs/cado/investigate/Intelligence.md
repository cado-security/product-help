# Intelligence Tab

When a Darktrace AIA incident occurs, any artifacts (file hashes, IP addresses, domains, etc.) associated with the incident are automatically extracted and converted into investigation-level IOCs.

These IOCs are then matched against evidence collected as part of the forensic investigation, to provide analysts with clear insights into suspicious and malicious activities as well as pivot points.
