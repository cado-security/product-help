# Investigation Overview

The **Investigate** section of the / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation platform is where you analyze imported evidence, explore events, and build understanding of what happened during an incident. An *Investigation* is the container that groups related evidence items (for example, disk images and logs) and provides tabs for analysis. 

Across the Investigate pages you’ll find:
- **Overview** — a high‑level summary of the investigation including investigator activity, key events, potentially compromised users/assets, and MITRE ATT&CK categories.   
- **Insights** — dashboards that surface key events, data sources, event types, indicator matches, and ATT&CK coverage to guide pivots.   
- **Automated Investigation** — an ML‑ranked narrative of what occurred, including trigger, verdict, suspected compromised assets, and a curated timeline of significant events.   
- **Timeline Search** — a powerful, faceted and query‑driven interface for deep‑dive analysis across all events and fields.   
- **Evidence** — a focused view to track each evidence item and its processing status, with controls to manage items.   
- **Files** — an explorer for navigating file systems and opening artifacts extracted from evidence.   
- **AI Investigator** — explains suspicious scripts/binaries/documents by describing behaviors like payload downloads or persistence.
