# What is the Automated Investigation Tab?

The Automated Investigation tab offers a summary of the findings from Cadoâ€™s investigation. It provides key insights into what was discovered during the analysis.

The Automated Investigation includes:
- **Investigation Trigger**: A description of how the investigation was initiated.
- **Verdict**: A concise, one-line summary of Cado's assessment of what occurred.
- **Suspected Compromised Assets**: A list of assets that may have been compromised during the event.

The timeline highlights up to 50 events, prioritizing those that are most significant. Events are more likely to be shown if they are flagged as malicious, tagged by a user, or occurred in rapid succession.
