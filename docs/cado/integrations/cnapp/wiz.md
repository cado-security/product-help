# How to Integrate Wiz with Cado

The Cado platform automates the processing and analysis of AWS EC2 EBS volumes acquired through the Wiz platform. By integrating Wiz with Cado, you can seamlessly automate the collection, processing, and analysis of AWS EC2 virtual machines without granting Cado direct access to the environment where the EC2 instances are located.
