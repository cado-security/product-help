# How to Estimate the Cost of the Cado Platform

To estimate the cost of using the Cado platform, you can base your calculations on the following typical assumptions:

- A central platform server running continuously with **500 GB of storage** for hot data access.
- **36.5 hours** of worker usage per month (approximately 5% of the time) to process data.
- **500 GB of permanent S3 storage** used for storing forensic images.
- **50 GB of Network File System (NFS) storage** for file transfer downloads.
