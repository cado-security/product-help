# How to Archive Investigations

Investigations can be automatically archived to reduce the space used by active investigations.
Archived investigations can then be restored to active investigations as required.

To enable automatic archiving of investigations:
- Enable "Archive Investigations" at **Settings** > **Experiments**
- Enable "Investigation Archiving" at **Settings** > **Advanced**

Investigations will then be archived once they reach the age threshold, on a schedule that checks for investigation age once per week.
