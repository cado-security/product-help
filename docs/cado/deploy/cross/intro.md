# How do cross cloud imports work in Cado?

Cado allows you to import data across different cloud environments, meaning that you can deploy Cado in one cloud (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) and import data from another. This is referred to as **cross-cloud** importing.

In a cross-cloud setup, Cado can seamlessly acquire data from cloud environments other than where the platform is deployed, enabling flexible and comprehensive data collection across multiple cloud providers.
