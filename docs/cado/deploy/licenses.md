# How to get and apply a license
In order to use the Cado platform, you must upload a valid license.  

If you have received a license file from your Sales representative, you can upload it by:
- Logging into your Cado instance
- Navigate to **Settings**
- Click the **License** tab
- Click **Select file**, choose the new license file 
- Click **Upload**

If you do not have a license, please contact sales@cadosecurity.com 

We also have a free edition of the Cado platform, [Cado Community Edition](/cado/community-intro), which provides a community license.
