# AWS Deployment Overview

/ Forensic Acquisition and Investigation provides flexible deployment options for AWS, allowing organizations to tailor their setup based on operational needs and security requirements. Whether you're looking for a quick start or a full-scale deployment with advanced processing capabilities, / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation supports multiple methods to get you up and running.

At its core, a / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation deployment in AWS consists of:

- **Infrastructure**: A core virtual machine that runs the platform.
- **Permissions**: IAM roles to manage the main VM and optionally start worker VMs.
- **Cross-account access**: Roles to import data from other AWS accounts or cloud providers.

Architecture diagrams and permission requirements are available to guide secure and compliant deployments.

## Permissions and Security

/ Forensic Acquisition and Investigation deployments require specific IAM roles and permissions to operate securely and effectively. These include:

- Permissions to manage the core VM.
- Permissions to start worker VMs (if applicable).
- Cross-account roles for importing data.

Private deployments with no internet access and proxy inspection are supported for environments with strict security requirements.
