Darktrace / Forensic Acquisition and Investigation provides AWS AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) for deployment in the following regions:

- **US Regions:**
  - us-east-1
  - us-east-2
  - us-west-1
  - us-west-2

- **European Regions:**
  - eu-west-1
  - eu-west-2
  - eu-west-3
  - eu-central-1

- **Asia-Pacific Regions:**

If you need to deploy the platform in a region not listed above, we can extend support by deploying our release AMIs to additional AWS regions. It's important to note that data acquisition is possible from all AWS regions, regardless of deployment location.

## AWS GovCloud Support

The platform also supports deployment in AWS GovCloud. We offer full support for both the **us-gov-west-1** and **us-gov-east-1** regions, ensuring compliance with government security requirements.
