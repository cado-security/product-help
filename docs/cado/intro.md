### Core Features

- **Automated Data Capture**: Cado enables automated data collection across multi-cloud environments and ephemeral containers, while also supporting investigations on on-premises systems.
  
- **Parallel Processing**: Powered by a patent-pending cloud-native architecture, Cado automatically scales to provide fast, parallel data processing.
  
- **Powerful Analytics**: Cado's analytics engine, enhanced by threat intelligence, machine learning, and built-in YARA rules, automatically flags malicious activity and potential risks.
  
- **Single Pane of Glass**: Cado presents data from multiple sources, including cloud-provider logs, disk, memory, and more, in a unified timeline, helping security teams quickly assess the scope and impact of incidents.

### Benefits

- **Cloud Scale**: Automate data capture across complex, multi-cloud environments without the need for agents.
  
- **Cloud Speed**: Utilize rapid, parallel processing to normalize vast amounts of disparate data in minutes instead of days.
  
- **Cloud Visibility**: Investigate a wide range of data sources, including cloud-provider logs, disk, memory, and more, all within a single, unified interface.
